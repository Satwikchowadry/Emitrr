# Emitrr - Task Board Application

## Project Overview

Emitrr is a React-based task board application that allows users to create boards and columns, add/edit/delete tasks with properties like title, description, priority, due date, and creator, and move tasks among columns. Data is persisted locally on the browser using LocalStorage, enabling users to keep their task state across sessions.

## Project Structure

The main React application is located inside the `task-board` folder in this repository. This folder contains:

- `src/` - React components and source code
- `public/` - Static assets
- `package.json` - Project dependencies and scripts specific to the React app

## Deployment
To deploy the app live (e.g., using Netlify or Vercel), **set the root/project directory to the `task-board` folder** when configuring build and deploy settings.

Publish directory:

## Scripts
